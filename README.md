## Deploying to Production

To create a production build, call `mvnw clean package -Pproduction` (Windows),
or `./mvnw clean package -Pproduction` (Mac & Linux).
This will build a JAR file with all the dependencies and front-end resources,

Once the JAR file is built, you can run it using
`java -jar target/3dmanager-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
